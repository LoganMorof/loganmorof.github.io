I recently embarked on an exciting adventure with two brilliant Michigan State University students, Logan Morof
and Riley Cook, to create a proof of concept chat AI app for personalized sleep analysis.

Our goal: harness the power of ChatGPT-4 to provide users with tailored sleep improvement suggestions based on Oura Ring data, which I wear 24/7 and it tracks things like exercise, sleep hours, stages of sleep, etc.

We faced surprising challenges, achieved breakthroughs, and grew throughout the process. We worked diligently to refine the user interface, optimize functionality, and integrate cutting-edge AI technology. I'm proud of what we built.

If you have an Oura ring, check out our YouTube video showcasing our app's capabilities: https://lnkd.in/gTq5GyTU ðŸ“¹

This journey has just begun, and we are eager to continue improving the software and discovering new ways to help people enhance their sleep and overall well-being through AI-driven personalization.

Stay tuned for more updates, and please share your thoughts and insights on our work!
